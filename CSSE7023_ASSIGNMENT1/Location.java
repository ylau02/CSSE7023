/**
 * <p>
 * An immutable class representing a location on a railway track.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A location on a railway track may be at either at a junction in the track, or
 * on a section of the track between the two end-points of the section.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: A location at a junction lies on all of the sections of track that are
 * connected to the junction; a location that is not at a junction, lies on only
 * one section of track.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A location can be identified by its offset with respect to an end-point of a
 * section of the track. However, the same location can be identified by
 * different descriptions. For example, given a section s of length 10 and with
 * end-points (j1, FACING) and (j2, REVERSE), the same location may equivalently
 * be described as being either 3 meters from junction j1 along its FACING
 * branch, or 7 meters from junction j2 along its REVERSE branch. A location
 * which is to be found at a junction, is represented as having a 0 offset from
 * the junction along any branch of the junction. For this reason, the
 * equivalence method of this class is more complex than usual.
 * </p>

/**
 * <p>
 * An immutable class corresponding to a section of a railway track.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A section of track has a positive length (in meters), and lies between two
 * junctions. These junctions may not be distinct, since a section of track may
 * form a loop from one junction back to the same junction.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In the context of a particular railway track, each junction has between one
 * and three branches (of type Branch) that connect it to sections of the track.
 * It can have at most one branch of each type. (I.e. a junction may not have
 * two branches of type Branch.FACING.)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * If a section forms a loop from one junction back to itself, then the junction
 * must be connected to the section on two different branches.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * A section is uniquely identified by its length and two distinct end-points,
 * where an end-point is a junction and the branch that connects it to the
 * section.
 * </p>
